# Library-Api

This is the backend component of my Library web service. It was made with ASP.NET Web API with Entity Framework Code First Migrations to interact with a SQL Server database. This api provides full CRUD capabilities to interact with book and author data. It also implements authorization to prevent unauthorized users from accessing/changing data. A normal user is allowed to view data but not change or delete it. An admin is allowed full access to the data.
